This year marked the tenth anniversary of the [Adobe ColdFusion Summit](https://cfsummit.adobeevents.com). It was great to get back together with so many familiar faces (and friends!) in person. I've attended all of the ColdFusion Summits and, I think, have spoken at all of them as well. I spoke at Summit this year about my favorite topic: ColdFusion and Amazon Web Services.

"Serverless Beyond Simple: Creating Complex Workflows with ColdFusion at the Center" is an architectural overview of what it takes to build resilient, complex serverless workflows in AWS that are controlled and managed by ColdFusion. The presentation is a distillation of many years of experience in building ColdFusion-based serverless workflows. Even if you're just getting started with serverless technologies, there's useful guidance in there for you. The presentation covers Simple Queue Service (SQS) vs. Simple Notification Service (SNS), the power of orchestration in AWS Step Functions, and managing the state of workflows in both locally and in DynamoDB. I'd be remiss if I didn't also say (as I did in the presentation) that the architectural patterns also apply to building workflows in Google Cloud and Azure.

A [PDF of the slides](https://brianklaas.net/assets/pdf/CFSummit2022-ServerlessNotSimple.pdf) from the presentation is available. None of this year's ColdFusion Summit sessions were recorded, so there is no video for me to share with you.
