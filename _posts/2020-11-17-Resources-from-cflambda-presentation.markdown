This week, I'm speaking at the [ColdFusion Summit 2020](https://cfsummit.adobeevents.com/schedule/) about "Building Serverless ColdFusion Applications with cflambda." [cflambda](https://helpx.adobe.com/coldfusion/using/aws-serverless-coldfusion.ug.html) is a new release from the Adobe ColdFusion team that's part of [ColdFusion 2021](https://community.adobe.com/t5/coldfusion/introducing-adobe-coldfusion-2021-release/m-p/11585468?page=1#M186888) and which lets you write AWS Lambda functions in ColdFusion. There are a number of resources referenced in the presentation that I'd like to share in this post:

- A [PDF of the slides](https://brianklaas.net/assets/pdf/CFSummit2020-cflambda.pdf) from the presentation
- The [cflambda function code](https://brianklaas.net/assets/code/exampleCodeFromCflambdaPreso.zip) from the presentation
- Paul Kukielâ€™s [sample API Gateway Lambda repo](https://github.com/kukielp/acf-lambda)
- [AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model)](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/)

More examples of calling Lambda functions &mdash; and other AWS services &mdash; from your ColdFusion applications can be found in my [AWS Playbox repo on GitHub](https://github.com/brianklaas/awsPlaybox).

Below are the recordings of two related presentations that I mentioned during this talk:

- [IAM: Build Fine-Grained Control of Amazon Web Services in Your ColdFusion App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucn90XLDlPw)
- [I Didn't Know S3 Could Do That!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNcOfG9Vkbg&list=PLG2EHzEbhy0-QirMKgSxhjkUyTSSTvHjL)
